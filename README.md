# pattern-matching
Reads a file of patterns and paths, spits out matching patterns.

## TODOs 
Add file streaming for larger files to improve speed, instead of reading entire file to memory
Explore lodash functions to speed up process of matching, filtering
Tests for various patterns and paths

## Observations
Interesting that for loops are rtechnicallyfaster than forEach, filter and reduce functions
